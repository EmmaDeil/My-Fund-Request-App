## 🛠️ **Development Workflow & Tools**

### **Local Development Setup**
```bash
# Complete development environment
git clone <repository>
cd MyFundRequestApp

# Backend setup
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Configure environment variables
npm start

# Frontend setup
cd ../frontend  
npm install
npm start

# Dashboard setup
cd ../dashboard-web
npm install
npm start
```

### **Production Deployment Workflow**
```bash
# Backend to Vercel
cd backend
vercel --prod

# Frontend to Render  
cd frontend
# Push to main branch triggers automatic deployment

# Dashboard (local administration)
cd dashboard-web
npm start # Always runs locally for security
```

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Email System Issues**
```bash
# Run comprehensive diagnostic
cd backend
node diagnostic.js

# Test specific request emails
node diagnostic.js --request-id YOUR_REQUEST_ID

# Check email delivery status in dashboard
cd dashboard-web
npm start
# Navigate to http://localhost:3001 → Email Management
```

### **Approval Link Issues**
If approval links show 404 errors:
1. **Verify Hash Router**: Check frontend uses HashRouter, not BrowserRouter
2. **Check URL Format**: Should be `https://domain.com/#/approve/token` (note the #)
3. **Test _redirects**: Ensure `_redirects` file exists in frontend/public for Render
4. **Manual Test**: Try copying approval URL directly into browser

### **Database Connectivity**
```bash
# Check database connection
cd backend
node diagnostic.js --database-check

# Verify environment variables
cat .env # Check MONGODB_URI is correct

# Test MongoDB Atlas connection (production)
# Ensure IP whitelist includes 0.0.0.0/0 for Vercel serverless
```

### **Dashboard Not Loading**
```bash
# Restart dashboard server
cd dashboard-web
npm start

# Check backend connectivity
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Verify toast notifications working
# Should see modern toast messages, not alert() dialogs
```
