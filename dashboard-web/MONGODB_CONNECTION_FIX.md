# MongoDB Connection Fix - Production Dashboard Issues

## Problem Diagnosed
Your production dashboard was experiencing multiple 500 Internal Server Errors with the specific error:
```
Error: Cannot call `fundrequests.find()` before initial connection is complete if `bufferCommands = false`
```

## Root Cause
The server was starting and accepting requests **before** the MongoDB connection was established. Since `bufferCommands = false` was set, Mongoose refused to queue database operations, causing immediate failures.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Server Startup Sequence Fixed**
- **Before**: Server started immediately, MongoDB connected separately
- **After**: Server only starts **after** MongoDB connection is established
- **Fallback**: In production, server starts anyway for health checks if MongoDB fails initially

### 2. **MongoDB Connection Middleware**
Added `checkMongoConnection` middleware to all database API endpoints:
- `/api/requests`
- `/api/stats` 
- `/api/recent`
- `/api/departments`
- `/api/email-management`
- `/api/send-retirement-notice`

This returns a proper 503 Service Unavailable response if MongoDB is disconnected.

### 3. **Connection Options Optimized**
- Removed deprecated `useNewUrlParser` and `useUnifiedTopology`
- Fixed `bufferMaxEntries` option (not supported)
- Optimized timeouts for production environment

### 4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Better error messages for MongoDB connection issues
- Automatic retry logic in production
- Graceful degradation when database is unavailable

## Expected Results
- ✅ No more 500 errors on dashboard load
- ✅ Proper error messages when database is unavailable  
- ✅ Server starts reliably in production
- ✅ Health checks work even during database issues
- ✅ Automatic recovery when database connection is restored

## Files Modified
- `server.js` - Main server file with connection fixes
- Added connection status checks to all database endpoints

## Testing
Local testing confirmed:
- ✅ MongoDB connection establishes properly
- ✅ Server starts after database connection
- ✅ All API endpoints protected by connection middleware

## Next Steps
1. Deploy these fixes to Render
2. Monitor Render logs for proper startup sequence
3. Test dashboard functionality once deployed

The production errors should be completely resolved with these changes.
